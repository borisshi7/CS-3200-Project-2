# PDF file
- Covered most requirements from step 1 to step 4, include:
  - Problem description
  - UML diagram (also uploaded to this repo)
  - Hierarchical tables (also uploaded to this repo)
  - Defined main collections (example object code and a datatype identification for the object)
  - Description on generating data and importing to MongoDB.

# Mock database objects creation
- I created the objects via Mockaroo, with the file [Mockaroo Photostock Database.csv](https://github.com/borisshi7/CS-3200-Project-2/blob/68bea95550a2631626b06c5afb2d5ff7973d0194/Mockaroo%20Photostock%20Database.csv) showing the full CSV file I used for querying.
- The schema file for creating the mock database https://github.com/borisshi7/CS-3200-Project-2/blob/68bea95550a2631626b06c5afb2d5ff7973d0194/Photostock%20Database%20generating%20schema.json is saved by clicking "Backup to file..." button after finalizing the schema.

# Query folder
- In the folder, each query has the query requirement written in the top of the file *(usually line 7)*
- [objectExample](https://github.com/borisshi7/CS-3200-Project-2/blob/68bea95550a2631626b06c5afb2d5ff7973d0194/Project%202%20Queries/objectExample.json) is the file that provides the example of the objects I'm using and querying.
